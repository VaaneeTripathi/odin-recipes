        <h2>Description</h2>
        This is an easy recipe for caramel brownies made with chocolate cake mix. A combination of caramels and evaporated <br>
        milk make the chewy caramel layer in the middle.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped</li>
            <li>2/3 cups evaporated milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
